    <p>“Hey Nikola, where are we supposed to dock?” Stephen asked. The three robots had just dropped out of warp speed
        and were coming up on the island to get some much-needed upgrades for the ship.</p>

    <p>“Hmmm, I’m not sure. Let’s call in.” Nikola opened a communications link to the station. “Elec-station this is
        Nikola, pilot for the the space ship -” He paused “Sofia, what’s the ships name again?”</p>

    <p>“OH! It’s the Oddysseus. After the famous adventurer!”</p>

    <p>“Oh okay, Elec-station, this is Nikola of the ship Oddysseus. Request permission for docking.”</p>

    <p>“Oddysseus, this is Elec-station. We confirm your arrival. Stand by to receive docking coordinates.” The station
        chief responded over the com unit.</p>

    <p>The computer spit out a sequence of capital letters that looked somewhat like ancient runes.

    <p>“Nikola, what in Turing's name is this rune-speak?” Sofia asked.</p>

    <p>“Ah, I should have mentioned it. This station has been open for a very long time. Instead of using the common
        Arabic numeral system, they use Roman numerals.”</p>

    <p>“Annnnnd we’re supposed to do what with these letters?”</p>

    <p>“They’re numbers. We need to transmit back our docking signature in Roman Numerals... Hang on, I’ll explain them
        so you can write a quick python function to translate the numbers for us.”</p>

<p>Roman numerals come from the ancient Roman numbering system. They are based
    on specific letters of the alphabet which are combined to signify the sum
    (or, in some cases, the difference) of their values. The first ten Roman
    numerals are:</p>
<p>I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X.</p>
<p>The Roman numeral system is decimal based but not directly positional and does not
    include a zero. Roman numerals are based on combinations of these seven symbols:</p>
<p>Symbol Value</p>
<p>I 1 (unus)</p>
<p>V 5 (quinque)</p>
<p>X 10 (decem)</p>
<p>L 50 (quinquaginta)</p>
<p>C 100 (centum)</p>
<p>D 500 (quingenti)</p>
<p>M 1,000 (mille)</p>
