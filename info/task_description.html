    <p>“Hey Nikola, where are we supposed to dock?” Stephen asked. Our three robots just dropped out of warp speed
        and were vastly approaching the island, to get some much-needed upgrades for the ship.</p>

    <p>“Hmmm, I’m not sure. Let’s call in.” Nikola opened the communications link to the station. “Elec-station this is
        Nikola, pilot of the space ship -” He paused “Sofia, what’s the ship's name again?”</p>

    <p>“It’s the Oddysseus. After the famous adventurer!”</p>

    <p>“Oh okay, Elec-station, this is Nikola of the ship Oddysseus. Request permission for docking.”</p>

    <p>“Oddysseus, this is Elec-station. We confirm your arrival. Stand by to receive docking coordinates.” The station
        chief responded over the com unit.</p>

    <p>The computer spit out a sequence of capital letters that looked somewhat like ancient runes.

    <p>“Nikola, what in Turing's name is this rune-speak?” Sofia asked.</p>

    <p>“Ah, I should have mentioned it. This station has been open for a very long time. Instead of using the common
        Arabic numeral system, they use Roman numerals.”</p>

    <p>“Annnnnd what are we supposed to do with these letters?”</p>

    <p>“They’re numbers. We need to transmit back our docking signature in Roman Numerals... Hang on, I’ll explain them
        so you can write a quick python function to translate the numbers for us.”</p>

    Roman numerals come from the ancient Roman numbering system.
    They are based on specific letters of the alphabet which are combined to signify the sum
    (or, in some cases, the difference) of their values. The first ten Roman
    numerals are:
</p>
<p>I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X.</p>
<p>
    The Roman numeral system is decimal based but not directly positional and does not
    include a zero. Roman numerals are based on combinations of these seven symbols:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Symbol Value</li>
<li><strong>I</strong> 1 (unus)</li>
<li><strong>V</strong> 5 (quinque)</li>
<li><strong>X</strong> 10 (decem)</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> 50 (quinquaginta)</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> 100 (centum)</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> 500 (quingenti)</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> 1,000 (mille)</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<p>For this task, you should return a roman numeral using the specified integer value ranging from 1 to 3999.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The string in the form of a Roman numeral.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">checkio(6) == 'VI'
checkio(76) == 'LXXVI'
checkio(13) == 'XIII'
checkio(44) == 'XLIV'
checkio(3999) == 'MMMCMXCIX'

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is an educational task and allows you to explore other numbering systems.
    It can alternatively be used for generating text, because roman numerals are often used in the typography.
    The year of construction on building faces and cornerstones is written by Roman numerals.
    These numerals have other uses in the modern world and you read about it
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Modern_usage">here.</a>.
    Or maybe you will have a customer from Ancient Rome ;-)
